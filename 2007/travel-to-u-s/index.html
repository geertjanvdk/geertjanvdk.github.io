      <p>Long time no blog!</p>

<p>Yesterday I started out at 09:00 CET and got in the hotel in Orlando, Florida (US) around 22:00 EST. I let you, dear reader, figure out how long that actually was. Lots happened in between and I&rsquo;m not going to make a complete novel of each point. But here is an overview of a few points, not much positive, as there was not much good, but I&rsquo;ll get to know US better next time, I hope..</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flight was great. 8 hours in a 747, I just sit there, did nothing, ate, watched 3 movies, listened to my iPod and just did nothing (I peed above New York though, hihihi). I was surprised.. but I&rsquo;m used to sitting anyway. While minding my own business I thought: how do I know US? Soaps, movies, CNN, history lessons.. Meanwhile, I got sick: ate something bad..</p></li>

<li><p>Washington D.C., Dulles airport: yeah! I needed fresh air. BADLY! And a toilet! OK, no fresh air, the first toilet was crappy.. I thought, lets go to the Red Carpet Lounge of United (had free voucher). Wrong! 2 hours I had to go through identity check, fingerprint scanning and getting myself photographed. I was pulled out to double check what I declared. Tip: do not write you have any dollars with you on the form unless over $10,000! DO NOT be honest, and sure not when you have a connecting flight! Or get screwed like the nice, I think Ukrainian girl traveling in group, probably missed her flight and was in deep problems.. Going in US you are treated as a criminal until you get out. Welcome? Right.. You can&rsquo;t even object, that&rsquo;s &lsquo;democrazy&rsquo; for you. Anyway, it&rsquo;s paranoid..</p></li>

<li><p>They put fast food in your hands on the plane. Candy and such. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your snack sir!&rdquo; Ships in plastic bag, a Mars candy bar and a sandwich. I ate the sandwich and the rest I gave back..</p></li>

<li><p>Waiting in Washington. No way out of the terminal. No fresh air. 3 hours. But I met my colleague Kristian, so I had company. While walking down the terminal I saw a few things which made me mad. A woman giving orders to two dozen kids: &ldquo;Red group come here to get your potato chips!&rdquo;, while she was opening a big box to get the fat-food out. 15 minutes later I passed the same group again: they were eating burgers and drinking soda. I had not my camera with me, but that was one for a WTF???</p></li>

<li><p>US eats with plastic. Some use big plastic bags to put over plastic bags to envelop them in other plastic bags to put a few plastic cups and some trash in there. Experienced the scene in the Red Carpet Lounge of United airlines. I looked for normal cups, non-plastic. Looking around I found none and I was about to give in, until I saw a few high above on a rack. It looked like decoration! I reached out and took one, it was real! A non-plastic cup to get coffee! WOOW!!! I refused to take food, only plastics. I&rsquo;m not that picky, but it was really getting on my nerves.. Btw, Starbucks apparently gives a discount when you bring your own cup, that&rsquo;s pretty cool!</p></li>

<li><p>People are friendly in US, sometimes a bit to friendly and you I don&rsquo;t know what to say. Like, &ldquo;Hello sir, how you doing?&rdquo; At first, I explained I am OK but a bit sick and explained and asked how s/he was. Then I understood you just have to ignore the question. Was bit funny there.</p></li>

<li><p>Spend my first $1,75 on a plastic bottle of water, which tasted good!</p></li>

<li><p>Peepholes when you do your big business in toilets. Note that, the toilets I sit on which were a few (I was sick, see above), it&rsquo;s filled half with water. Why? It easier to keep them clean I guess, but I guess more water is used. Or? Still confused. Same in hotel..</p></li>

<li><p>I saw no graffiti yet in Orlando. It&rsquo;s to clean too, to much order, to straight forward. They use numbers for bus stops! Weird, but it&rsquo;s another country of course. I don&rsquo;t see such differences in Europe though.</p></li>

<li><p>You have to tip in US. Restaurants and pubs or so. Part of their wages apparently..</p></li>

<li><p>Funny situation in hotel. I went my room, unpacked (learned that from my friend Russell), unmacked my bed just to feel at home and went to the bathroom. Oops. They didn&rsquo;t clean it up. Double Oops, there is a bag in there. Triple Oops! It&rsquo;s from a woman! The bra I pulled out was confirming that. I ran down and said there was a problem. I literally said: &ldquo;Well, I have no problem sharing a room with a woman, but I guess she would have a problem with me.&rdquo; Sometimes I say silly things. Anyway, got new room.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now a list of things what was the first time for me on this trip</p>

<ul>
<li>First time on another continent.</li>
<li>First time in US.</li>
<li>First time a stamp in my passport.</li>
<li>First time a long distant flight.</li>
<li>First time I saw Da Vinci code movie, which I didn&rsquo;t really like (book was great though).</li>
<li>First time I spend a dollar.</li>
<li>First time getting a ride in an American car.</li>
<li>First time US internet connection.</li>
<li>First time Starbucks (nothing special to me)</li>
<li>And more..</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s nice&hellip; I&rsquo;m not disappointed..</p>
