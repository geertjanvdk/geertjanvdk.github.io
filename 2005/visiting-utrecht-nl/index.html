      <p>I got the opportunity to travel for my job to <a href="http://www.utrecht.nl">Utrecht</a>, The Netherlands. Almost two weeks, though I spend the weekend with my parents in Belgium. It had been good, learned lots about MySQL Cluster (which was the intention), visited the city and got stressed by bikes!</p>

<p>My first day was weird. I do speak Dutch, but since I&rsquo;m starting to learn German and speak/write/read lots of English, I&rsquo;m starting to have problems when speaking my mother tongue. I got totally confused when I asked something in Dutch to a lady, and got an answer in English, while she was speaking Dutch with her husband. I was really wondering in what language I addressed her, so continued in English..</p>

<p>The first hotel was <a href="http://www.parkplaza.com/">Park Plaza</a>, just near the train station. I forgot how much was being payed, but if I recall correctly it was a special price. What I do know is that the internet connection was 22 EUR for a day, or better an evening.. Way too much if you ask me. But ok, it was a good connection and we needed it.</p>

<p>I shared the room with my colleague Harrison who flew all the way from upstate New York. This was the first time we were meeting, which was a good excuse to go for a nice dinner! We went to <a href="http://www.kingarthur-utrecht.com/">King Arthur</a>. There I learned that <a href="http://www.duvel.be">Duvel</a> was quite famous indeed! Had 2 of them, my colleague liked it as well and we had some good food.</p>

<p>My work was attending a training, and of course I just can&rsquo;t say here where it was and for who it was. But it was great: useful training (3 days!), nice atmosphere, and good to see an office again.</p>

<p>Utrecht, I guess like any other Dutch town/village, has lots of traffic. Cars, buses, and.. bicycles! We had to catch a bus just at the train station, and it was so stressful to cross a street for bicycles! They are driving fast in both directions, have apparently total priority and I think will kill you as a pedestrian! I&rsquo;m driving my bike as well, but usually on the normal streets along the cars, but this was crazy. Well, it&rsquo;s good they do it, it&rsquo;s good for the environment, but when you see that for the first time.. And the buses are driving nuts as well. I haven&rsquo;t seen any accidents, so I guess the people there are just used to it.</p>

<p>The second week was no training, but me shadowing my colleague Partha, who flew in from New York city. This was a full week and I got in on Monday. We stayed in a Thai hotel/restaurant called <a href="http://www.littlesiam.nl/">Little Siam</a>. I must say, it&rsquo;s like nothing compared with a the Park Plaza. It&rsquo;s the thing you would go to when you need a cheap room, fast. We shared a room with two beds, and it had a bathroom. Most other rooms were sharing a shower in the hallway. The room was also not always cleaned etc.. Well, I usually don&rsquo;t complain, people might like it and I did a little bit, but not enough to recommend.</p>

<p>On Friday I had my train back home to Aschaffenburg, Germany. I took a bus to the train station, nice on time. Arriving there, there were lots of people, weird. Oddly, no train was announced, so I went to international information desk and they told me that 10 minutes ago a power failure prevented all trains driving into the station! Well, so far for my nice drive back home! Strangely enough most Dutch people there stayed calm and later I heard it happened before. I guess they&rsquo;re getting used to it. My ticket had full flexibility so I just took the train the next day. Lucky my colleague was still at the hotel so I could spend the night there.</p>

<p>Overall, Utrecht is a nice place. I got disappointed first day but that was because of the neighborhood of the train station. Once in the city center, there are lots of nice places to spend a nice evening (which I did with somebody I knew from IRCNet!). So, if you got stuck there for an hour waiting for a train, you have something to do.</p>
