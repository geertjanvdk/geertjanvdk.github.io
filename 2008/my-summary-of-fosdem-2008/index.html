      <p>I came home very tired yesterday, just walking around as a big MySQL billboard and I left with mixed feelings really.</p>

<p>First feelings were Happiness + Anger (=Love??). I had a nice dinner with Bruce and Magnus (PostgreSQL) on Thursday, met others at their booth and attended a few talks both Saturday and Sunday. I&rsquo;m interested in their stuff, I do like PostgreSQL, just like probably everyone else in MySQL. But, I got very angry about 2 remarks made in the DevRoom: &ldquo;MySQL loses data&rdquo; and the infamous and idiotic &ldquo;MySQL has no transactions&rdquo;. FFS! The latter was corrected on the spot, that REALLY pissed me off (remark made by non-PostgreSQL crew btw).</p>

<p>Anyway, overall, I did like what I was hearing, the project is going well, and lots of cool stuff coming in! Very nice! Funny thing though: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s using Partitioning?&rdquo;, one guy (as far as I could see) put up his finger.</p>

<p>Next feeling: Amazed! Drupal! I don&rsquo;t like PHP, bah, in fact, I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;m not doing it anymore. But what Drupal is doing there, and the attention it gets is just great! I really liked what I heard and the way it&rsquo;s used to teach Managers about web design (or something) is pretty cool. MySQL Cluster was tried, but it can&rsquo;t fit a moderate Drupal database. This is pretty normal, and the talk of Kris Buytaert actually mentioned alternatives (Master-Master replication, MySQL Proxy, ..) to overcome this. I had the opportunity to actually tell the crowd that MySQL ain&rsquo;t just for small websites.. Another one of these lies and myths..</p>

<p>Last feeling for the future: hopeful! Yes, I tried to get us a place in FOSDEM next year, and it looks like it might getting somewhere! We should have a DevRoom there! <em>hint</em>!</p>

<p>Interesting is also a new PHP user group getting formed, but that will get some attention later on. I&rsquo;ll try to help the guys out to get it running. Meeting up with Patrick from Sun was also great. Seeing old friends, drinking a beer (Duvel, counts for 3), and surviving wearing a MySQL shirt. My colleagues kept lower profile, hehe, I felt like a billboard.</p>

      Hi Geert!<br /><br />First of all - nice meeting you at FOSDEM! I&#39;m sure some people would be surprised to see two PostgreSQL guys having dinner with two MySQL ones - and one in-between:er - but I&#39;m not. That happens all the time between the community people themselves - the &ldquo;fights&rdquo; are usually orchestrated by outsiders..<br /><br />As for the remarks - I hope (and think) I wasn&#39;t one of them ;-) (even though my personal experience with MySQL has been just that - but I&#39;m no expert on setting it up, so that&#39;s likely why it happened) If I was, my apologies. It&#39;s certainly well known in the PostgreSQL community that MySQL has transactions these days - even though we may not agree with how they are implemented.<br /><br />As for the comment you received - I actually discussed that with someone else (sorry, can&#39;t remember whom). Why this comes up over and over again, even though MySQL has had them for quite a while. The conclusion we could come to was that it&#39;s probably some backlash from having for many years clearly stated that nobody needs transactions, so why have them. That changed quite a while ago, but communities can have long memories.<br /><br /><br />Magnus
