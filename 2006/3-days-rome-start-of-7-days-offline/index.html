      <p>I planned to stay 10 days off-line, but I got back earlier. So it was 7 days without internet, without mobile phone. The only communication with the outside world was through the good old postcards to family and friends. Ok, I send one email to say I was OK since there was a deadly accident in Rome in the metro when I arrived..</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-771"></a>
I never thought I would have visited this once mighty city so soon in my life, but there I was. Breathing in the toxic air of burned gasoline, trying to not get run over by cars or scooters, ignoring the hectic noises.. Nevertheless, it was great seeing lots ancient buildings and imagining how it was before christianity put a crucifix on every obelisk. Fools! But also a big thanks to them for preserving lots!
Rushing through the city, I experienced a big part of Rome and it&rsquo;s hills mostly walking around. There are not much subway lines (2) or stations. Which is fine, I can imagine they dare not to dig to much or they would hit some archaeological wonder again!
A tip is maybe to get a good map with you and wander off the big roads into the more narrow streets. Especially around Piazza Navona.</p>

<p>The number of tourists looks bigger with the small piazzas. I understood now that Rome is like Mekka for fans of Jesus et al. If you think Tivoli would be more relaxed.. Well, don&rsquo;t go there on a weekday. I toke a bus back to Rome after trying to appreciate it for half an hour.</p>

<p>Some small stories:
- I forgot to look up the address for a Deutsche Bank so I looked passively the first day for one. In the evening it occurred to me that a simple phone book would have helped me lots! Moral: If you go offline, think offline.
- After the second night, I packed in the morning, went for a nice breakfast and said everyone my good byes. &ldquo;Erm, you staying one more night you know?&rdquo; said Ren&eacute; from the <a href="http://www.romanhostels.com/">Chaplin B&amp;B</a>. I looked an idiot, but I could blame my watch. Moral: Your offline devices do not sync with atomic clocks by themselves.
- Listening to a guide at the Pantheon: &ldquo;.. and it was build in 27 and .. &ldquo;, &ldquo;BC?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Of course BC!&rdquo;.
- For insiders: &ldquo;Please, Per favor, change, mangare, per favore&hellip; <em>ring</em>&hellip; Pronto!&rdquo; Lots of fake beggars, and worse: rude ones too. Advice: do not give money as lots of them nag you down because you didn&rsquo;t give enough! And definitely not the ones who are crawling the streets face down!</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a great visit. I&rsquo;ll have to go back to actually go inside and see the art stored in the buildings. But I&rsquo;m not in a hurry, as I find it an awful place and still wonder how people can survive there..
Next stop is Firenze (Florence)!</p>

<p>Links:
- <a href="http://www.romanhostels.com/">Chaplin B&amp;B</a>: nice place to stay and though close to main train station, still quiet neighborhood.
- <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/sets/72157594343226438/">Pictures on Flickr</a>, lots of pictures have comments on them.</p>
