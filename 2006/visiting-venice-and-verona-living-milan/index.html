      <p>In my previous post I said I was for a couple of weeks living in Milan, Italy. It gives me the opportunity to travel around in Italy. I do everything <a href="http://www.trenitalia.it/en/index.html">by train</a> and other common transport. I found it not expensive: for a ticket from Milan to Venice you pay like 24 EUR for 2nd class on the fastest train; even cheaper if you add like 30-40 minutes.</p>

<p>Last Saturday (7 Oct 2006) I started off with Venice. It&rsquo;s a must-have-been-there place and it was indeed pretty spectacular. I took a 12 EUR day ticket for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/263376255/in/set-72157594317547881/">vaporetto</a>, which you can compare to a subway but then on water with boats (amazing!). I would advise anyone to take that one and use it at least 3 times (single trip is 5 EUR!!) if you are only there for a day. If you go, give it away like I did and make somebody happy (it&rsquo;s valid 24h).</p>

<p>Venice I compared to a forest of stone. Except for the busy touristic areas like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/263368994/in/set-72157594317547881/">San Marco</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/263371867/in/set-72157594317547881/">San Polo</a>, it&rsquo;s quite like in a forest: no cars, sometimes a boat, some people, fresh air. For working from home it would definitely be a nice place! Don&rsquo;t forget to visit <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/263374871/in/set-72157594317547881/">Cannaregio</a>, it&rsquo;s often forgotten but it gives a view how people actually live in Venice.</p>

<p>Venice can be done in one day if you go alone (forget romance for a day..) and don&rsquo;t go to much inside checking stuff out and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/263367461/in/set-72157594317547881/">wait endlessly in line</a>. Take a line going around the city on the sea. It&rsquo;s great and included in the day ticket! If you seen and know how Venice works, the next visit you can plan to actually go inside some buildings like the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/263368372/in/set-72157594317547881/">Basilica San Marco </a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/263366832/in/set-72157594317547881/">Campanile</a>.</p>

<p>Here the complete set of pictures: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/sets/72157594317547881/">One day in Venice, Italy</a></p>

<p>The following day (8 Oct 2006) I went in the early morning from Milan to Verona. The original plan was actually to stay in some hotel around Venice or in Verona. But I was to late to book anything, so I took the more cheaper approach: travel back to Milan, which in the end is cheaper.. and takes only about 3.5 hours.</p>

<p>But: I got stopped by some policemen! I was taking pictures from the huge Milan train station, but suddenly a policeman was waving to me. I thought I was standing where I should not (usually do that) and was moving along making other pictures.. Then I saw these policemen coming over in my direction through my camera! &ldquo;Oh Oh&rdquo;, I thought. &ldquo;English?&rdquo;, said the officer which I confirmed not going into endless details. &ldquo;Show me pictures!&rdquo; So, I showed him the last, then previous, and then he saw it. &ldquo;You make picture of me. You can not do.&rdquo; Then I understood.. I&rsquo;m usually careful about this, but I didn&rsquo;t see them. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/264848668/in/set-72157594314163100/">The picture was OK</a> though, it was too blurry for them to get recognized.</p>

<p>Verona is like Rome (I think): old! From the train station I was disappointed a bit, but after walking the whole way Porta Nuova to the Piazza Br√† I forgot about the stressy traffic around the city. There was the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265011836/in/set-72157594319807342/">Arena</a>! Holy goodness: that&rsquo;s big and old and original! It hurt my knee while climbing <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/264999444/in/set-72157594319807342/">the stairs</a> inside. I wonder how the smaller people from that time did it.. Maybe they were not as heavy as I? Maybe..</p>

<p>Going along some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265008299/in/set-72157594319807342/">shopping street</a> I reached Piazza Ebre. If you stand in front of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265007872/in/set-72157594319807342/">this fountain</a> of the 14th century, what do you do? Well, I make a picture, and wonder what people were doing at that time, where I was standing.. Probably wearing something better than I (I really don&rsquo;t fit into Italian dress..code). Or maybe they just washed their hand after going doing their daily business.</p>

<p>Going around I wandered from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265005781/in/set-72157594319807342/">church</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265003576/in/set-72157594319807342/">church</a>, from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265018048/in/set-72157594319807342/">bridge</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265024793/in/set-72157594319807342/">bridge</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265016900/in/set-72157594319807342/">castle</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265032269/in/set-72157594319807342/">castle</a>.. Oh, it was a long long walk.. Venice was still in my legs, and the climb to the top of a hill was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/265017421/in/set-72157594319807342/">worth it</a>, but..</p>

<p>Verona is great because it has a river slaloming through it. Somehow I just love having a river making it more alive. The fact that there is not much traffic inside the inner city, makes it a nicer place than for example Milan (which is bigger..). A must do, and I guess another must do is the whole region around Verona with the Lago Di Garda, a big lake. I&rsquo;m thinking to go back maybe coming weekend, but we will see.</p>

<p>More pictures? Yeah, sure: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/sets/72157594319807342/">One day in Verona, Italy</a></p>

<p>Milan? Still trying to figure it out. I compare it with an espresso: small and compressed (at least the center). I don&rsquo;t really like it much that I would ever consider live here longer, but it&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p>Continuously updating set of pictures: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/sets/72157594314163100/">A few weeks in Milan, Italy</a></p>
