      <p>For those following this blog and wondering where &lsquo;day 1&rsquo; disappeared too: we didn&rsquo;t go! Indeed! We missed Tool, Deftones, Manu Chao and Red Hot Chili Peppers! Why? Because there was this ceremony of my sister&rsquo;s school where the last years were getting their end results. It was her final year, so I had to be there. Be we missed Tool and the Peppers!</p>

<p>But this post was about &lsquo;day 2&rsquo; of <a href="http://www.rockwerchter.be/">Rock Werchter</a>, which was a nice, sunny day where the shadows were popular and a breeze a relieve.</p>

<p><a href="http://shoot.some-abstract-type.com/v/Visiting/Happenings/RW2006/Day2/">Pictures of Rock Werchter, day 1</a></p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-748"></a>
<a href="http://www.abrand.be">A Brand</a>, a belgian band, opened in the Pyramid Marquee. I didn&rsquo;t know them very well except for the single Hammerhead which I heard a few times on the radio. It&rsquo;s rock and roll with lots of guitars.</p>

<p>For 5 minutes I lost my sister. I actually stood right beside her and then suddenly she was gone. I was sure she was looking for me somewhere a bit further but the crowd must have been  bigger than her (well, not difficult, hihihi). Anyway, I saw her red hat and we continued to the next band.</p>

<p>The Main Stage opened by the rock diva Skin, but we went to the band after her: <a href="http://www.editorsofficial.com/">Editors</a>. My first impression was like Interpol but easier on lyrics and music. I found it OK for starting the day.</p>

<p>This was the first time really in the sun and it was burning my neck. I found nothing better than shortening my trousers and use it as cover. This resulted in me having pants looking very weird.</p>

<p>The Marquee was now really getting full as people were mostly looking for shelter against the sun. <a href="http://www.clapyourhandssayyeah.com/">Clap your hands say yeah</a> was playing, but we decided to sit down outside and enjoy it sitting in some shadow. It proved to be a good decision. The music itself was again, &lsquo;OK&rsquo;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.elbow.co.uk">Elbow</a> was unknown to me and my sister so we decided to give it a shot. This was the first band I listened too with something in my ears to reduce the &lsquo;noise&rsquo; with 35 decibels. It proved to be good, not for the loud music really, but for the annoying, loud, french speaking folks around us! Elbow didn&rsquo;t move me really.</p>

<p>After struggling our way to the 80000 people attending the festival, we arrived at the Main Stage again to check out <a href="http://www.friendsoflive.com/">Live</a>. This was a band I remembered from when I was &hellip; young. That means now like 12 years ago or so. It was great to see them and it was a good set in my opinion. The teenage girls went totally crazy when the lead singer took of his shirt or when his brother got a close up on the video screens.</p>

<p>We skipped Anouk as we enjoyed fries and &lsquo;loempia&rsquo; (Spring rolls) and did a short time in the Marquee listening too Vitalic. My sister enjoyed it but I got a headache and went for a walk. Lucky I got back to her in time to head for Main Stage again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.muse.mu/">Muse</a> was probably the band everyone was waiting for. It was a fantastic set. Everybody jumping on the hard, rock moments between the ballad like interludes with this beautiful voice topping it.
My sister was totally going wild. A prove of this was she was clapping above her head though everybody else had already stopped for a while. Looked funny, shame I didn&rsquo;t had my camera handy.</p>

<p>Overall a nice day, but really Live and Muse especially made it really good. Today (Saturday, day 3) will be better with a line up ending with Placebo and dEUS: it will be hot! And not only due to the heavy summer weather predicted today!</p>
