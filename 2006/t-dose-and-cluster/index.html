      <p>I attended the T-Dose open source event yesterday in Eindhoven (The Netherlands) and it must be said: the TU/e (Technical University of Eindhoven) looks pretty nice indeed! Entering the T-Dose I was a bit overwhelmed by the venue. However, on Saturday, the crowd was thin. Of course, it was the first time and I hope it will be as big as FOSDEM in Brussels some day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.upservers.nl">UPservers</a> which is selling certified hardware for MySQL and MySQL Cluster. It&rsquo;s interesting to actually have face-to-face contact with people actually having a clue about hardware.</p>

<p>Gnome and KDE had a booth there as well. Yes, it has evolved a bit again. However, I left the Linux workstation for MacOS X: just because I got lazy I guess.</p>

<p>Before my MySQL Cluster rambling, the audience was animated by Martin from <a href="http://www.webhuis.nl/">Webhuis</a>. He actually took off his tie and put on a rambo-look which the audience appreciated but was not really planned! The talk itself was about migrating from MicroSoft Exchange to an open source stack based on Samba, OpenLDAP and Open Exchange. I think his company having this experience will get some business. Quite interesting.</p>

<p>Sadly enough, the migration from Exchange had more attendees than my MySQL Cluster talk! Well, I guess migrating from MicroSoft to anything else is indeed far more interesting (<em>kugh</em>). Well, I didn&rsquo;t count but I guess between 20 or 30 learned what MySQL Cluster is or picked up something new.</p>

<p>I was not happy though. There is something still wrong with my slides to learn people about MySQL Cluster in a fun, relaxed way having only an hour. Also, I need to get the tempo correct. At FrOSCon in Bonn is was better, but I didn&rsquo;t get to the end there.</p>

<p>One of the attendees of the 2nd Belgian MySQL User Group meeting early in the week talked with me and my colleague Roland Bouman about genetic research. I don&rsquo;t know enough about it, but they have problems with the magnitude of data.Next I was introduced to <a href="http://www.syllable.org">Syllable</a>. I saw it booting in some seconds and the fact that there is not much application for it makes it more interesting for me. Why? The lesser you have, the lesser can fail or give problems. Don&rsquo;t know, but why not have a small fast OS for MySQL?</p>

<p>The day ended for me at the conferences learning about Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.0 and virtualization using Xen. It was interesting because I never actually looked into this before. I&rsquo;m still sceptical about it all. All application would work on a take over.. I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it with MySQL and InnoDB for example.</p>

<p>Going for a beer I talked with Matt about <a href="http://www.openqrm.org">OpenQRM</a>. Interesting stuff again! One just has not time enough or gets to distracted maybe.</p>

<p>Nice day there at T-Dose. It was just nice and I hope it will grow. It&rsquo;s a nice venue, nice people, nice topics.. Oh, and I got a Red Hat t-shirt too!</p>
