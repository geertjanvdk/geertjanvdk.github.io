      <p>I&rsquo;m not as specialist as other people with bicycles, but at least I have the will to pick it up and go drive for hours. So, on Friday I woke up and decided to go for a 2 day drive down the river Main (in Germany) and visit most of the towns I pass.</p>

<p>I made pictures which can be found on following URLs:
<a href="http://shoot.some-abstract-type-shit.com/main.php?g2_itemId=3110">Visiting Würzburg</a>
<a href="http://shoot.some-abstract-type-shit.com/main.php?g2_itemId=3319">River Main (part 1)</a>
<a href="http://shoot.some-abstract-type-shit.com/main.php?g2_itemId=3384">Visiting Gemünden and Lohr am Main</a></p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-739"></a></p>

<p>Saturday I started out a bit late because I had some trouble fixing some gear on I bought the day before. Yes, not good idea to check on your bike just before leaving, but it just makes it more exciting! Breakfast, shutdown my machines, I took off taking the train in <a href="http://www.aschaffenburg.de">Aschaffenburg</a> at 10:20 (train was late, hooray!) to Würzburg where I arrived around 11:45. Train was packed with cyclists!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wuerzburg.de">Würzburg</a> disappointed a bit at first around the train station. I think it&rsquo;s in most cities like that. Once past this, the city opens up a bit more and shows what it got. I learned going through the city that it was actually totally destroyed by [American bombs during World War II](). Quite a tragedy, and it answered my questions why there weren&rsquo;t much more old buildings..
Two highlights were <a href="http://www.wuerzburg.de/tourismus/sehenswertes/31,1576.html">Residenz</a> Castle and the <a href="http://www.wuerzburg.de/tourismus/sehenswertes/31,1919.html">Festung Marienberg</a>. The latter one I visited more thoroughly since it just got me curious, standing there up the hill.</p>

<p>The journey continues, after this short visit to Würzburg, downstream along the river Main. The plan was to get to <a href="http://www.wertheim.de">Wertheim</a> somehow, either by bicycle or train. Though, I only made it till Gemünden, a small town after <a href="http://www.karlstadt.de">Karlstadt</a>. The latter one I missed, as I took the wrong (painful) road, only to join the regular route after crossing the Main. It started raining heavier and I had to put on my jacket. Add to that that it wasn&rsquo;t really warm, and very windy: I was shivering. So I decided after having a meal and some apple juice in Gemünden, to take the train towards <a href="http://www.lohr.de">Lohr am Main</a>, where I could hopefully take a train to Wertheim.</p>

<p>This is were I got it wrong and I should have planned better. There was no train to Wertheim from Lohr, and it was too far away to get there by bike (was already past 18:00). So, I took a ticket back to Aschaffenburg and quickly visited Lohr, which was beautiful. I only had 10 minutes, it was raining, and I was getting really tired.</p>

<p>The trip I planned for 2 days, ended in a 1 day trip, but it was worth it. I&rsquo;m not used to do these things and this is how I will learn it best. Preparing is a must, though it&rsquo;s more fun to just pick your lazy butt up and get on the road! I will do the rest of the Main later, well, maybe tomorrow. Just hoping not to get to much rain, at least not all the way.</p>

<p>Part 2 is coming!</p>
