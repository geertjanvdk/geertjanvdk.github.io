  <div class="article-content clearfix">
    
      <p>I set out Monday morning to <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perros-Guirec">Perros-Guirec</a>, a village at the west coast of France, west from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St-Malo">St-Malo</a>. We have an important meeting with MySQL customer and I had to be there. Everything was carefully planned, I had my tickets and I knew when to leave.. on time..</p>

<p>Well, it didn&rsquo;t go the way I expected..</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-767"></a>
So I set out at 05:30 to the train station of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aschaffenburg">Aschaffenburg</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>. Train was at 06:06 and would arrive like 06:52 just in time to take the train to Paris at 07:02. I managed to stay awake, but when lots of people got on train I got distracted and a bit dreaming away. I heard the speaker say &lsquo;Darmstadt&rsquo; and I get out. But something was wrong.  This was not a big train station: this was &lsquo;Darmstadt Nord&rsquo;! As I turned around to get back in the train it closed its doors. &lsquo;Damn! $%&amp;^$%^&rsquo; It&rsquo;s 06:46 and I kind of panicked.</p>

<p>I ran out the station to look for a taxi, none there. Asked around and got a telephone number from the wall. Great! Called; got me a taxi; told I had like 2 to 4 minutes to get to the main train station. Of course, we didn&rsquo;t manage. 07:03 and my direct train to Paris just left. Damn!</p>

<p>Ok, first thing, getting yourself together; next second, find the information booth and ask for next train. Great, there was next one around 11:00 but I would be like midnight at destination. Damn! Ok, I went to the ticketing service and I said: &lsquo;Get me to Paris, now, or any time you can rebook my tickets&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And unbelievable: the guy got me a route out of the system which would lead me to the train I have to take in Paris Montparnasse to Guingamp. &lsquo;It would cost you like 170 EUR more though&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;OK! Just get me there!&rsquo;. The route was: Darmstadt to Frankfurt, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterCityExpress">ICE train</a> to Brussels followed by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalys">Thalys</a> to Paris Nord. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/some-abstract-type/241631496/in/set-72157594270506509/">Holy Smoke</a>! Perfect!</p>

<p>Trains are wonderful when it all works out, and it was all working out until in Frankfurt: &ldquo;Our ICE to Brussels will leave 10 minutes later to meet some correspondence&rdquo;. I stayed calm.</p>

<p>Getting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aachen">Aachen</a> with the ICE to Brussels they got the 10 minute delay already solved. They can do that by driving a bit faster. Pretty cool! But in Aachen: &ldquo;Due to works between Liege and Aachen we expect 10 minutes delay. Sorry for that.&rdquo; Owkay. Time for a small panic and ask if we made it in time for the Thaleys to Paris. &ldquo;Should be no problem,&rdquo; the train manager says, &ldquo;they waited for us yesterday, the week before, so.. we will let you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Entering Brussels: the ICE managed to get the delay again down to 1 minute! Thaleys waited for us, and there I was: going to Paris, fetching my other train. The rest of the travel went pretty great and relaxed. I met with my colleague Jimmy at the trainstation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guingamp">Guingamp</a> and checked in perfectly in time in the hotel.</p>

<p>Dinner was ended with a big, giant icecream called &lsquo;Pink Panther&rsquo;.. it caused some laughter in the restaurant when it got served to me and some pictures were taken.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, we worked some hour on the meeting after dinner. Honest! Now to bed to visit the beach at Perros-Guirec in the morning (right).</p>
