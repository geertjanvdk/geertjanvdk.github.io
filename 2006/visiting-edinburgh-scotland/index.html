      <p>With mixed feelings I left Edinburgh early this morning. I spend more than 2 days in the historic capital of Scotland to celebrate my birthday, to have some real vacation, but more to fulfill my curiosity. I have seen lots of Edinburgh by walking through, but I failed to fall in love with the city, though I will go back and explore Scotland the country, as the Highlands are attracting me.</p>

<p>The first day, 13th of June, was great. I felt a bit lost walking over Calton Hill to Holyrood abbey but was treated with a nice view over Edinburgh, the sea in the north, and Arthur&rsquo;s Seat in the southwest. As a first impression, this was good!</p>

<p>Walking down Calton Hill I ran into the Palace of Holyroodhouse. I didn&rsquo;t enter it as out of budget and not on schedule (like I had one!). I planned to do the Royal Mile to the Edinburgh Castle. It&rsquo;s actually a few streets going from east to west which make up the Royal Mile, along which the old town was build.
Nice shops selling kilts and lots of appealing pubs I passed but I marched towards the entrance of the castle. Checking out some sideshows/streets I lost a bit sight of time and came late to the castle. Lots of tourists, lots of busses, and my mood sank. I didn&rsquo;t want to visit it with so many people around. So I decided to do it the next morning, early, and that proved to be good choice. It opens at 9:30, but be sure to be there a bit earlier.</p>

<p>I had dinner the first day in Guilford Arms. A nice pub right over the Balmoral Hotel. I tasted some Scottish Ale and Lager and enjoyed the football games. The next day, day of my birthday I had lunch on the Royal Mile in a pub called The Milter. I picked a table, and by luck it was number 29! I made a picture of the table as it was a bit funny. Dinner that day was again in the Guilford Arms as I didn&rsquo;t want to have trouble to find food that evening.</p>

<p>As I said, mixed feelings. Historically Edinburgh is great! If you see the Honours in the castle and read the history about it, it just gives me an unbelievable feeling. Walking through the streets you see nice places, and the pubs I visited are great. The city is alive with friendly people, mostly; helpful, cheerful, which is probably there job, but it felt good. I had a bit trouble understanding them though.
On the other hand, the city is very noisy, to much cars stinking and they are driving to fast (IMHO). This was a major screw up for me, the morning of my birthday going up the Leith Walk to the center. I even didn&rsquo;t hear my phone ringing. Maybe it&rsquo;s me getting old.
Lots probably improved with the public transportation, but these buses are actually crazy how fast they drive. I think they are improving all this.</p>

<p>Edinburgh isn&rsquo;t a city I would like to live, but I&rsquo;ll definitely go back for some more days if I allow myself. Or at least while traveling through, because I really need to explore the Highlands.</p>
